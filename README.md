What is Shell Scripting
Text files containing commands to execute by a shell are called shell scripts. In this, long and repetitive series of commands are compiled into a single script that can be stored and executed at any time, thereby reducing programming efforts. In shell scripts, repetitive work is largely avoided. The most common reason for using shell scripting is to program operating systems of Windows, UNIX, Apple, etc. In addition, companies use this script to develop an operating system with their own features. In terms of system-level operations, it is considered to be the easiest programming language to use. A shell script is referred to as a batch file in DOS operating system, and EXEC in IBM's mainframe VM operating systems. Shell scripts can be used for the following applications:

Automation of the code compiling process.
Run a program or create an environment for programming.
Complete batch processing and file manipulation.
Integrate existing programs.
Perform routine backups.
Keeping an eye on a system.
System administration's tasks
Creating, maintaining, and implementing system boot scripts
A sample shell script: 
echo "hello world" 

Run it as follows: 
$ bash hello.sh 
# prints 
hello world 
Shell Scripting Interview Questions for Freshers
1. What is Shell?
A Shell is basically a command-line interpreter between user and kernel or a complete environment specially designed to run commands, shell scripts, and programs. In this, whenever a user enters human-readable commands (input commands) through the keyboard, the shell communicates with the kernel to execute these commands, and display output in a shell script. Just as there are different flavors of operating systems, there are also different types of shells. Every shell has its own set of commands and functions. Shells issue the prompt, $, called a command prompt. You can type into the prompt while it is displayed.  

After you press enter, your input is read by the shell. Based on the first word of your input, it determines the command you want to run. The characters in a word are separated using spaces and tabs.  

Example: 

Here is an example of a date command that displays the current date and time:  

$date Tue Aug 10 06:03:35 MST 2021![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59536110/178111131-e961c7f5-1882-47cb-948c-df03eb9d4436.png)
. Why is a shell script needed?
Shell scripts can be written for a variety of reasons:

Keeping repetitive tasks to a minimum.
Can be used by system administrators for routine backups.
Monitoring the system.
Adding new functions to the shell.
Shell scripting allows you to create your own tools.
System admin can automate daily tasks.
3. Write some advantages of shell scripting.
Shell scripting offers the following benefits:

An interactive debugging tool, as well as a quick start.   
Programmers need not change their syntax since both command and syntax are identical to those entered directly into the command line.  
Shell scripts are easy to use and quicker to write.   
It helps automate administrative tasks, so it is time-saving.   
As shell scripts are written in an interpreted language, they can be run without any additional effort on almost any modern operating system, including UNIX, Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X.  
They can be utilized for bulk execution rather than single instructions.   
Using it, you can develop your own custom operating system with relevant features.  
Software applications can be developed according to their respective platforms with this tool.
